            <h2>1.BLADE RUNNER</h2><br>
            <p>Blade Runner conjures a bleak vision of a then-future 2019 Los Angeles – an imperious
                flame-belching hellscape in which Harrison Ford's 'blade runner' cop Rick Deckard is tasked with
                tracking down a group of human-engineered Replicants who have escaped back to Earth from a working
                colony. As he 'retires' them one by one, he comes to question his own humanity, both literal and
                metaphorical. With its ruminations on what it means to be human, Blade Runner is ideas-driven sci-fi all
                the way. But it's a visual feast too, its interpretation of a futuristic urban landscape – with giant
                video screens, glowing neon lights and bustling city streets – still jaw-dropping to behold. Coupled
                with a haunting Vangelis synth score, and Rutger Hauer's arresting turn as Replicant leader Roy Batty
                , it's nigh-on untouchable.</p>

            <h2>2.INTERSTELLAR</h2><br>
            <p>Having finished off his Bat-trilogy, Christoper Nolan got back to his own, original work. Interstellar
                reads to some as another cold Nolan experience, more concerned with the intellectual exploration of
                space travel and the mysteries of wormholes, but it's so much more. Hard science (or at least as hard as
                you can go with experimental physics, as advised by Kip Thorne) doesn't mean hard hearted – this is
                Nolan's love letter to love itself, particularly between fathers and daughters. Matthew McConaughey's
                emotional reaction to the message from his grown daughter, his Joe Cooper caught up in a mission where
                time passes differently for him than it does on Earth – is a key part of that. Nolan stitches it all
                together into a cohesive whole, and elicits excellent work from his cast, which also includes Anne
                Hathaway and Jessica Chastain.

            <h2>3.LOOPER</h2><br>
            <p>Following high school noir Brick and sibling conmen story The Brothers Bloom, Rian Johnson surprised with
                this time-crossing assassin story. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's titular "Looper" is a hired killer for the
                mob, who kills victims sent back in time so they can disappear from 39 years in the future. But when
                Joe's next target is his own older self — closing the loop is the fate of all Loopers, who are paid well
                for their trouble — he's thrown off his game and future Joe (Bruce Willis) escapes. The ensuing cat and
                mouse chase takes further twists, but Johnson keeps it all juggled like a pro. The choice to make
                Gordon-Levitt (in prosthetics) and Willis play the same character is a risky one, but it works, and
                Johnson injects the movie with plenty of invention.

            <h2>4.INCEPTION</h2><br>
            <p>A filmmaker ever-fascinated by the architecture of the human mind, Christopher Nolan externalised the
                human subconscious into physical environments for a Bond-inspired heist-movie blockbuster. Taking place
                across multiple levels of malleable reality, Inception imagines the possibility of dream-tech that
                allows Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb and his team to infiltrate sleeping marks and extract information
                from their unconscious minds – until he's given the altogether harder job of implanting an idea into his
                next target. Through dizzying setpieces and narrative convolutions, Nolan embraces dream-logic, subverts
                physics, and orchestrates collapsing realities, creating a psychological sci-fi spectacular that's sure
                to boggle minds for decades to come.

            <h2>5.BACK TO THE FUTURE</h2><br>
            <p>
                Time travel and the ripples that spread out from someone changing the past are concepts that are
                incredibly hard to pull off. Yet few films are as perfectly constructed as the first Back To The Future.
                Certainly some try to pick plot nits, but there are few to find. Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale
                conjured up a tale that's so satisfying to watch, even if chunks of it had to be re-shot when original
                star Eric Stoltz didn't work out. Replacement Michael J. Fox rode the role to movie star status,
                bolstered by a great ensemble, and gave the movie the core it required to work like a well-wound watch.
                Crucially, it cemented the most widely-understood model of fictional time-travel, even if later
                time-twisting films have sought to debunk it.

            <h2>6.THE MATRIX</h2><br>
            <p>
                The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is
                the first installment in The Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne
                Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly
                trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract
                humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under
                the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other
                people who have been freed from the Matrix.

                The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The film popularized a visual
                effect known as "bullet time", in which the
                heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to
                progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the
                sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally.

            <h2>7.ARRIVAL</h2><br>
            <p>
                A time-twisting short story by Ted Chiang. A script from Eric Heisserer. Denis Villeneuve in the
                director's chair. It's a combination, allied to top work from Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams that delivers
                the knockout punch that offers both brainfood and a heart-breaking through-line. Aliens arrive in giant
                ships and humans must figure out how to communicate with the strange creatures, expanding on the first
                contact idea that has fascinated humanity for years, but with extra layers. Time becomes flexible and
                you'll want to revisit it more than once to steep in both the atmosphere and the story.

            <h2>8.A SPACE ODESSY</h2><br>
            <p>
                Talk about scope. Stanley Kubrick's monolithic work of sci-fi might not have much in the way of a
                tangible linear plot, and yet it covers so much – the dawn of man, the space race, the arrival of
                artificial intelligence, greater space exploration, and a journey into the cosmic unknown. It's dizzying
                stuff, realised with technical bravado by Kubrick, open to endless interpretation and with just enough
                narrative to remain compulsively watchable. From its gigantic rotating sets, to its use of Strauss's The
                Blue Danube, to its extraordinary climactic light show, 2001 is an audio-visual marvel – while its
                explorations of human evolution and where it might go next have already proved prescient. An
                extraordinary piece of work, deeply influential on decades of cinema since, and one that entrusts the
                viewer to follow along on an instinctual, sensory level.
