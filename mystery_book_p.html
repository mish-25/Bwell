            <p>Daisy Wells’ and Hazel Wong’s detective society doesn’t have much to do at Deepdean School for Girls;

            <h2>5.THE LONDON EYE MYSTERY</h2><br>
            <p>
                Siblings Ted and Kat’s cousin Salim is visiting with his mum. The trio decides to have a day in London
                and head to the London Eye, but frustratingly the queue is very long. Then a stranger approaches the
                cousins, offering his ticket for the Eye – which he can’t bring himself to ride now because of his
                claustrophobia. Having never been on the Eye, Kat and Ted encourage Salim to take it. They wave their
                cousin off onto one of the pods, but when it comes back down half an hour later, Salim is nowhere to be
                seen. Has he been abducted? Did he ever get off the London Eye? It’s up to Ted and Kat to find out.
