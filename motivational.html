            <h2>2.THINK AND GROW RICH NEPOLEAN HILL</h2><br>
            <p>Think and Grow Rich is a book written by Napoleon Hill in 1937 and promoted as a personal development and
                self-improvement book. He claimed to be inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and
                later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.First published during the Great Depression, the book has sold more
                than 15 million copies

                It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill's books. BusinessWeek magazine's Best-Seller List ranked
                it the sixth best-selling paperback business book 70 years after it was published. Think and Grow
                Rich is listed in John C. Maxwell's A Lifetime "Must Read" Books List.

                While the book's title and much of the writing concerns increasing income, the author proclaims that his
                philosophy can help people succeed in any line of work, to do and be anything they can imagine.

                Think and Grow Rich is based on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, and is the result of more than
                twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes.

            <h2>3.THE SECRET BY RHONDA BYRNE</h2><br>
            <p>The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, based on the earlier film of the same name. It is
                based on the belief of the pseudoscientific law of attraction, which claims that thoughts can change a
                person's life directly. The book alleges energy as assurance of its effectiveness.Byrne
                re-introduces a notion originally popularized by persons such as Madame Blavatsky and Norman Vincent
                Peale that thinking about certain things will make them appear in one's life. Byrne provides examples of
                historical persons who have allegedly achieved this. Byrne cites a three-step process: ask, believe, and
                receive. This is based on a quotation from the Bible's Matthew 21:22: "And all things, whatsoever ye
                shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."

                Byrne highlights the importance of gratitude and visualization in achieving one's desires, along with
                alleged examples. Later chapters describe how to improve one's prosperity, relationships, and health,
                with more general thoughts about the universe.

            <h2>4. 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE BY STEPHEN COVEY</h2><br>
            <p>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, first published in 1989, is a business and self-help book
                written by Stephen R. Covey.[1] Covey presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by
                aligning oneself to what he calls "true north" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as
                universal and timeless. Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with
                caring for that which
                produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden
                eggs. He further claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio, where P refers
                to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results. Covey presents his
                teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence through independence on to
                interdependence.

            <h2>5.THE ALCHEMIST BY PAULO COELHO</h2><br>
            <p>
                Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling
                in its powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago,
                who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the
                Pyramids.

                Along the way he meets a Romany woman, a man who calls himself a king, and an alchemist, all of whom
                point Santiago in the right direction for his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or whether
                Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles in his path; but what starts out as a journey to find
                worldly goods turns into a discovery of treasure within.

                Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming
                power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.

            <h2>7.ATOMIC HABITS BY JAMES CLEAR</h2><br>
            <p>The book emphasizes on the following-
                An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but is also the
                source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.
                Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have
                the wrong system for change.
                Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing
                to stick with them for years.

            <h2>8.THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A FCK BY MARK MANSON</h2><br>
            <p>
                The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is a book about finding meaning in important things in life and only
                having those values that an individual can control. Whatever value (such as popularity) that is not
                under a person's control, is a bad value to have and a person should strive to replace it with something
                more controllable such as punctuality, honesty, or kindness. Manson further advises avoiding claiming
                certainty about the knowledge that is out of one's grasp and not worry about leaving a legacy for the
                posterity. Instead of worrying about building a body of work as a legacy, one should seek to create joy
                in the moment for one's self and those around.

                The Power of Positive Thinking: A Practical Guide to Mastering the Problems of Everyday Living is a 1952
                self-help book by American minister Norman Vincent Peale. It provides anecdotal "case histories" of
                positive thinking using a biblical approach, and practical instructions which were designed to help the
                reader achieve a permanent and optimistic attitude. These techniques usually involved affirmations and
                visualizations. Peale claimed that such techniques would give the reader a higher satisfaction and
                quality of life.
