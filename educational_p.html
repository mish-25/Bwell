            <h2>1.BACK TO THE FUTURE</h2><br>
            <p>In this 1980s sci-fi classic, small-town California teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is thrown back into
                the '50s when an experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) goes awry.
                Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents
                (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson), and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even
                more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown.</p>

            <h2>2.SOUND OF MUSIC</h2><br>
            <p> The backdrop of the war and fleeing from Austria might not be relevant to most kids. But what the movie
                helps children understand is that a positive perspective towards life can help you wade your way out of
                trouble. Julie Andrews who plays Maria in the movie is an inspiring character. She is an amazing singer
                and she sings to drive away the sadness of life. She also teaches the kids to sing and soon they sing
                their own tunes too.

            <h2>3.CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY</h2><br>
            <p>The importance and spirit of honesty is the cornerstone of the movie. When Charlie wins the golden ticket
                to enter Willie Wonka’s chocolate factory, he has every chance to leak the secrets of the factory and
                let go of his poverty. But he stays honest and true and wins the grand prize as a result of it. As kids
                grow up, teaching them the importance of honesty and the importance of truth can be quite difficult, but
                a movie like this will teach them everything.

            <h2>4. POLAR EXPRESS</h2><br>
            <p>Late on Christmas Eve, after the town has gone to sleep, a boy boards the mysterious train that waits for
                him--The Polar Express. When the boy arrives at the North Pole, Santa Claus offers him any gift he
                desires. The boy asks only for a bell from the harness of Santa's reindeer. But on the way home, the
                bell is lost. Christmas morning, the boy finds the bell under the Christmas tree, and when he shakes it,
                the bell makes the most beautiful sound he's ever heard. His mother admires the bell, but she laments
                that it is broken ... for, you see, only a true believer can hear the sound of the bell.

            <p>
                When Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber), the children of the wealthy and uptight Banks
                family, are faced with the prospect of a new nanny, they are pleasantly surprised by the arrival of the
                magical Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). Embarking on a series of fantastical adventures with Mary and her
                Cockney performer friend, Bert (Dick Van Dyke), the siblings try to pass on some of their nanny's sunny
                attitude to their preoccupied parents (David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns).

            <h2>7.FINDING NEMO</h2><br>
            <p>
                Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish, is overly cautious with his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has a
                foreshortened fin. When Nemo swims too close to the surface to prove himself, he is caught by a diver,
                and horrified Marlin must set out to find him. A blue reef fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) -- who has
                a really short memory -- joins Marlin and complicates the encounters with sharks, jellyfish, and a host
                of ocean dangers. Meanwhile, Nemo plots his escape from a dentist's fish tank.
