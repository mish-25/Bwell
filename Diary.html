    There are many reasons why we journal. From travel journals, dream journals, gratitude journals to prayer journals, we keep 
        specific journals for different aspects of our life. In the past, many people kept personal journals, where they recorded 
        the day's events and their observations. Without diarists like Anne Frank and Samuel Pepys, we wouldn't know much about the 
        personal side of our history.<br>
        There are many benefits of keeping a journal:<br>
        1. Keeps your thoughts organized.<br>
        2. Improves your writing<br>
        3. Relieve stress.<br>
        4. Record ideas on-the-go<br>
        <br>
        Here's a space for you to vent your feelings.
