            <h2>1.THE HATMAKERS</h2><br>
            <p>In this debut from actress Tamzin Merchant, young Cordelia comes from a long line of hatmakers. But
                they’re no ordinary hatmakers. They’re Makers who can weave alchemy and enchantment into every hat – a
                rare and ancient skill that only a few still possess. Cordelia’s father Prospero often has to take his
                ship, The Jolly Bonnet, overseas to acquire the magical ingredients needed for hat making. But this time
                his ship goes missing. Cordelia is determined to find him; however, an ancient Maker rivalry and
                potential war are threatening to surface</p>

            <h2>2.DAUGTHER OF TE DEEP</h2><br>
            <p>Rick Riordan's underwater adventure is perfect for fans of Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
                the Sea. Set at Harding-Pencroft Academy; a high school that produces the best marine scientists, naval
                warriors, navigators, and underwater explorers, the story follows freshmen Ana Dakkar. At the end of the
                school year, she and her classmates are sent away on a top-secret trial at sea. But on the bus ride, the
                pupils witness a terrible tragedy and are thrust onto a dangerous quest for answers.

            <h2>4.KAY'S MARVELOUS MEDICINE</h2><br>
            <p>We loved learning all about the inner workings of the human body in Kay’s Anatomy. And now, former doctor
                Adam Kay is taking us back in time to when doctors knew far less about how our bodies worked than they
                do now. Did you know that it used to be illegal for medical students to dissect anyone? And that doctors
                used to operate WITHOUT any anaesthetic? We hope you have a strong stomach.

            <p>
                After losing both of her parents, 10-year-old Mary Lennox is sent from her home in India to live in her
                uncle's bleak manor on the Yorkshire Moors. Mary is spoilt and disagreeable, but also incredibly lonely.
                Bored one day, she explores her uncle's grand estate and comes across an old key that opens the door to
                a hidden garden. Neglected just like Mary, the young orphan tends to the garden and ends up discovering
                the magic of kindness.

                split them up. Will the orphans make it through life on the run? A stunning debut about the power of
