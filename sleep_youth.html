                    <li>Students are one of the most sleep-deprived populations. </li>
                    <li>Research at Brown University has found that approximately 11% of students report good sleep, 
                        while 73% report sleep problems.</li>
                    <li>Because sleep affects concentration, memory, and learning ability, sleep deprivation has been 
                        related to poorer GPAs in students.</li>

                    In an ideal world, everyone would wake up feeling refreshed. But, in reality, we all know 
                    that saying it is easier than doing it. It's difficult to get enough rest. And you don't 
                    always feel rested when you do sleep. When sleeping problems persist they can significantly 
                    affect our mental health, making it hard to participate in daily life like work, school, and 
                    social activities.

                    <br>
                    Regular and restful sleep is essential for good health. Everyday activities such as going to class, 
                    working out, or working on a computer can strain your mind and body, but sleep helps you feel less 
                    stressed and even helps you to maintain a healthy diet. Sleep deprivation, on the other hand, can 
                    have a negative impact on critical elements of your mind and body, including your mood, vitality, 
                    ability to learn, memory, good judgement, reaction time, and efficiency.

                    The average adult needs eight hours of undisturbed sleep per night. However, this differs from person to person.

            Sleep deprivation raises hormone levels, which can alter mood and stress. It can lead to problems with concentration, 
            memory, judgment, problem solving and reaction time, and worsen symptoms related to your mental health disorder.
            If you aren't getting enough sleep, your coping abilities and academic performance will suffer. It may be more 
            difficult to pay attention in class, study, and, most importantly, perform well on an exam.
