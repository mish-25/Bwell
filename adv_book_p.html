            <p>A peasant boy in medieval England endures his mother’s death. To make matters worse, after witnessing a
                clandestine meeting between the abusive village steward and a prominent stranger, he is discovered and
                accused of a crime he didn’t commit. The steward declares him a “wolf’s head”, to be killed on contact
                by anyone who sees him. As Crispin flees for his life, he meets an immense, irascible juggler named
                Bear. In this epic tale of survival, Crispin and Bear must weave through the forests like fugitives,
                evading capture and certain death.</p>

            <h2>7.MATHILDA</h2><br>
            <p>
                Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off
                double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates
                love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in
                Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived.
                Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss ("The") Trunchbull, a former
                hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer.
                Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing
                intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.

                She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she
                rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is
                never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable.

            <h2>8.THE BFG</h2><br>
            <p>
                Captured by a giant! The BFG is no ordinary bone-crunching giant. He is far too nice and jumbly. It's
                lucky for Sophie that he is. Had she been carried off in the middle of the night by the Bloodbottler,
                the Fleshlumpeater, the Bonecruncher, or any of the other giants-rather than the BFG-she would have soon
                become breakfast.

                When Sophie hears that they are flush-bunking off in England to swollomp a few nice little chiddlers,
                she decides she must stop them once and for all. And the BFG is going to help her!
