            <h2>1.LITTLE BADMAN AND THE TIME TRAVELLING TEACHER OF DOOM</h2><br>
            <p>You’ve heard of Humza Khan, right? And if you haven’t, where have you been? He’s Eggington’s greatest
                11-year-old rapper! He’s also survived killer aunties, deadly alien slugs AND double maths. Pretty
                impressive. But in Little Badman and the Time-travelling Teacher of Doom, Humza’s up against his
                fiercest opponent to date – his dad. Humza’s dad doesn’t think he’s disciplined enough, so he’s sending
                Humza off to summer school in Pakistan. But this is no ordinary school, and something has been messing
                with time.</p>

                of growing up with many hilarious and awkward moments.

            <h2>3.AWESOME FRIENDLY SPOOKING STORIES</h2><br>
            <p>Rowley Jefferson has already proved he’s a talented storyteller with Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly
                Adventure, and now he’s turned his hand to writing some spooky tales. There’s a boy who changes into a
                werewolf, a ghostly friend, and a scary scanner. But don’t be too alarmed: these stories may sound
                frightening, but they’re also filled with all the hilarity you know and love from the Diary of a Wimpy
                Kid universe.

            <h2>4.THE SUMMER I ROBBED A BANK</h2><br>
            <p>Things are not going too great for Rex at the moment. His parents have split up and so for the summer
                holidays, he’s being sent to a very remote, very wet, sheep-inundated Irish island. The upside? He gets
                to stay with his brilliant and slightly odd Uncle Derm. But then it turns out that his uncle is planning
                on robbing the island’s travelling bank – and he wants Rex to help him! Written by comedian David
                O’Doherty and featuring fun illustrations by Chris Judge, this bonkers but heart-warming adventure is

            <p>
                Life with his little brother, Fudge, makes Peter Hatcher feel like a fourth grade nothing. Whether Fudge
                is throwing a temper tantrum in a shoe store, smearing mashed potatoes on the walls at Hamburger Heaven,
                or trying to fly, he's never far from trouble. He's an almost three-year-old terror who gets away with
                everything, and Peter's had it up to here! When Fudge walks off with Dribble, Peter's pet turtle, it's
                the last straw. Peter has put up with Fudge for too long. Way too long! How can he get his parents to
                pay attention to him for a change?
