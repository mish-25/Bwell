            <h2>1.THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY BY PATRICIA GIGHSMITH</h2><br>
            <p>Since his debut in 1955, Tom Ripley has evolved into the ultimate bad boy sociopath, influencing
                countless novelists and filmmakers. In this first novel, we are introduced to suave, handsome Tom
                Ripley: a young striver, newly arrived in the heady world of Manhattan in the 1950s. A product of a
                broken home, branded a "sissy" by his dismissive Aunt Dottie, Ripley becomes enamored of the moneyed
                world of his new friend, Dickie Greenleaf. This fondness turns obsessive when Ripley is sent to Italy to
                bring back his libertine pal but grows enraged by Dickie's ambivalent feelings for Marge, a charming
                American dilettante. A dark reworking of Henry James's The Ambassadors, The Talented Mr. Ripley—is up to
                his tricks in a 90s film and also Rene Clement's 60s film, "Purple Noon." </p>

            <h2>2.THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO BY STIEG LARSSON</h2><br>
            <p>Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared over forty years ago. All
                these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading
                journalist recently trapped by a libel conviction, to investigate. He is aided by the pierced and
                tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and
                astonishing corruption.

                An international publishing sensation, Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo combines murder
                mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into one satisfyingly complex and

            <h2>4.THE DA VINCI CODE BY DAN BROWN</h2><br>
            <p>While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night.
                The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling
                symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they
                are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all
                to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.

                Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members
                included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret.
                Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who
                shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.

            <h2>5.THE SILENT PATIENT BY ALEX MICHAELIDES</h2><br>
            <p>
                Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a
                fashion shoot, and Alicia
                shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.

                Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far
                grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of
                her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the
                Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.

                Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with
                Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes
                him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him.

            <h2>6.THE WOMAN IN CABIN 10 BY RUTH WARE</h2><br>
            <p>
                Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a
                lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm,
                and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in
                the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner
                parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck,
                gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman
                being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if
                nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone
                terribly, terribly wrong.

            <p>
                Christine wakes up every morning in an unfamiliar bed with an unfamiliar man. She looks in the mirror
                and sees an unfamiliar, middle-aged face. And every morning, the man she has woken up with must explain
                that he is Ben, he is her husband, she is forty-seven years old, and a terrible accident two decades
                earlier decimated her ability to form new memories.

                Every day, Christine must begin again the reconstruction of her past. And the closer she gets to the
                truth, the more unbelievable it seems.

            <h2>8.GONE GIRL BY GILLIAN FLYNN</h2><br>
            <p>
                On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding
                anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful
                wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t
                doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but
                passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge.
                Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town
                golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly
                evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?

            <h2>10.THE GUEST LIST BY LUCY FOLEY</h2><br>
            <p>
                On an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives
                together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and
                ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress,
                the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty
                and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.

                But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the
                festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well
                wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally
                ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.

                And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?
