            <h2>1.SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS</h2><br>
            <p>Directed in 1954 by one of the foremost screen musical directors of all time, Stanley Donen, Seven Brides
                is filled with rousing songs and exciting dance sequences. While it is not the most politically correct
                plotline by today’s standards, the story is nothing but wholesome and family-friendly. Fine vocal
                performances by Jane Powell and Howard Keel make this one a memorable choice.</p>

            <h2>2.SOUND OF MUSIC</h2><br>
            <p> The backdrop of the war and fleeing from Austria might not be relevant to most kids. But what the movie
                helps children understand is that a positive perspective towards life can help you wade your way out of
                trouble. Julie Andrews who plays Maria in the movie is an inspiring character. She is an amazing singer
                and she sings to drive away the sadness of life. She also teaches the kids to sing and soon they sing
                their own tunes too.

            <h2>3.BYE BYE BIRDIE</h2><br>
            <p>Filled with light, happy music that your kids will be humming for months, Bye Bye Birdie is a lovely
                confection. Star-studded with the likes of Dick Van Dyke and Janet Leigh, the plot centers on a plan by
                a small-town songwriter to get a big-time rock ‘n roll singer to record one of his songs. Kids will
                definitely appreciate the teenage perspectives that permeate the plot.

            <h2>4. ELLA ENCHANTED</h2><br>
            <p>One of the only modern film musicals to make this list, Enchanted features the engaging Amy Adams as a
                fairy-tale princess who gets transported to real-world Manhattan. Witty, fast-paced and filled with fun
                and memorable music, Enchanted shouldn’t be overlooked by fans of movie musicals and their little ones.

            <h2>5.SINGIN IN THE RAIN</h2><br>
            <p>
                There may not be kids appearing on the screen in this one, but this classic MGM musical is a
                crowd-pleaser for all ages. If your kids are particularly interested in how movies are made, especially
                back in the early years of the business, then they’ll be fascinated by this film, which is widely
                regarded as the best movie musical ever made.

                Leading man Gene Kelly stars as a silent-film era celebrity who is one half of the greatest leading
                couple in movies. Hollywood is ready to enter the “talkie” era, but Kelly’s partner has a squeaky voice
                that could derail both of their careers. Hilarity that the whole family can appreciate ensues.

                Rogers than with their best movie? This flawless film is fun for everyone, featuring glamorous sets and
                costumes as well as dreamlike dance sequences. With a score by Irving Berlin, there are plenty of

            <h2>7.THE WIZARD OF OZ</h2><br>
            <p>
                If your kids haven’t seen The Wizard of Oz, now is a great time to introduce them. The plotline is based
                on L. Frank Baum’s literary classic, giving you a chance to introduce the book and its adaptation to
                celluloid. Although some small kids may find the Wicked Witch of the West scary, most will be charmed by
                the adventures of Dorothy and her dog, Toto.

                Along their journey through Oz, Dorothy and Toto encounter timeless, endearing characters like the
                Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. Dorothy learns some important lessons along the way, and so do
                many of the other characters. It’s a wholesome and magical entertainment that has delighted kids of all
                ages for decades.
