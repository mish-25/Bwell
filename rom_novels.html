            <h2>1.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE BY JANE AUSTEN</h2><br>
            <p>Pride and Prejudice, all time classic, is an 1813 novel of manners written by Jane Austen. The novel
                follows the character
                development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions
                of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual
                goodness.

                Mr. Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is
                entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces
                becoming very poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to
                support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot.

                Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of "most-loved books" among literary
                scholars and the reading public. </p>

            <h2>4.WUTHERING HEIGHTS BY EMILY BRONTE</h2><br>
            <p>Wuthering Heights is an 1847 novel by Emily Brontë, initially published under her pen name Ellis Bell. It
                concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the
                Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with Earnshaw's adopted son, Heathcliff. The novel was
                influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction.

                Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature, but contemporaneous reviews were
                polarised. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, and for its
                challenges to Victorian morality and religious and societal values.

                Wuthering Heights was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Brontë's Agnes Grey before the
                success of their sister Charlotte's novel Jane Eyre, but they were published later. Charlotte edited a
                second edition of Wuthering Heights after Emily's death which was published in 1850. It has inspired
                an array of adaptations across several media, including English singer-songwriter Kate Bush's song of
                the same name.

            <h2>8.THE HATING GAME BY SALLY THORNE</h2><br>
            <p>
                Lucy Hutton and Joshua Templeman hate each other. Not dislike. Not begrudgingly tolerate. Hate. And they
                have no problem displaying their feelings through a series of ritualistic passive aggressive maneuvers
                as they sit across from each other, executive assistants to co-CEOs of a publishing company.

                Lucy can’t understand Joshua’s joyless, uptight, meticulous approach to his job. Joshua is clearly
                baffled by Lucy’s overly bright clothes, quirkiness, and Pollyanna attitude.

                Now up for the same promotion, their battle of wills has come to a head and Lucy refuses to back down
                when their latest game could cost her her dream job…

                But the tension between Lucy and Joshua has also reached its boiling point, and Lucy is discovering that
                maybe she doesn’t hate Joshua. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another
                game.

            <p>
                Ever since her journalist mother died on assignment, Marin has played it safe, refusing to set foot
                outside the state of Tennessee. Her wild-child younger sister, Sadie, has trotted the globe as a
                photographer, living off of art and adrenaline. When Sadie returns from a tough assignment abroad and
                looks a little worse for wear, Marin reluctantly
                agrees to a sisters’ spa weekend on the tropical island of Saba. But her lifelong fear of travel is
                affirmed when Sadie misses the flight, Marin’s luggage gets mixed up with another passenger’s, and an
                episode of turbulence sends her hurtling into the lap of Lucas Tsai, the handsome stranger who stole her
                sister’s seat. For the first time in a long time, Marin has to step outside of her comfort zone as she

            <h2>10.BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY BY HELEN FIELDING</h2><br>
            <p>
                Bridget Jones's Diary portrays a year in the life of 30-something, career-minded Bridget Jones. Bridget
                is a self-involved woman concerned with her weight, appearance and securing a boyfriend. The book is
                written as a diary and tracks Bridget's life during a twelve-month span, beginning with her New Year's
                Resolutions. Her resolutions include quitting smoking, drinking less, losing weight, finding a
                boyfriend, getting a better career, and not dating emotionally unavailable men.

                The chapters of the book represent the twelve months of the year. Each chapter is broken up into daily
                entries. Most of the daily entries begin with a tally of Bridget's weight, alcohol consumption,
                cigarettes smoked and parenthetical comments on her progress. Because the book is written like a diary
                the language is very frank and honest. The author has even come up with a set of abbreviations, which
                the reader easily catches on to such as "v." for "very" or "v.g." for "very good."
