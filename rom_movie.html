            <h2>1.WHEN HARRY MET SALLY</h2><br>
            <p>It can be hard to find something new to say about Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron’s romantic classic, because
                it has topped lists and been so praised in the past. How it hits you in both the heart and the funny
                bone is just part of why this one works, putting together Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal’s initially
                unlikely lovers. There are the endlessly quotable exchanges, Carrie Fisher stealing scenes like she’s
                wearing a mask and a striped jumper and the sort of lasting impact that so many movies in the genre have
                failed to match before or since.</p>

            <h2>2.CASABLANCA</h2><br>
            <p>Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman. One iconic gin joint. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the
                story of emotionally bruised bar owner Rick and the return of Ilsa, the old flame who left him
                emotionally distant, is univeraslly regarded as one of the all-time greats. Its central love story is
                bittersweet, with a sacrificial pay-off that only bolsters its emotional impact. When you’ve seen it
                once, you’ll be desperate to play it again.

            <h2>3.FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL</h2><br>
            <p>In one fell swoop Richard Curtis made the jump from Blackadder to the big-screen, propelled Hugh Grant
                and Mike Newell’s careers, and defined a whole new era of British rom-coms. Four Weddings and a Funeral
                delivers on the bittersweet promise of its title, balancing foul-mouthed dialogue with chocolate box
                London locales, all topped off with a rain-soaked feel-good finale.

            <h2>4.ANNIE HALL</h2><br>
            <p>How far Woody Allen’s private life can be extricated from his work is still an ongoing conversation, but
                viewed in a cultural vacuum (if such a thing is possible or even advisable), Annie Hall stands as one of
                the finest rom-coms ever made. Diane Keaton is the titular Annie, the laid-back lover of neurotic
                stand-up comic Alvy. The film avoids emotional grandstanding and instead focuses on the minuscule
                everyday moments that bring flashes of muted joy and disappointment on a daily basis, topped with
                fourth-wall-breaking gags and wry asides. It’s unlikely to win new fans, but hard to forget for those
                who have already seen it.

            <h2>5.BEFORE SUNSETS</h2><br>
            <p>
                Leave it to Richard Linklater to experiment with the format and find something new to say about how love
                evolves across the years. A follow-up to 1995’s Before Sunrise, it catches up with Ethan Hawke’s Jesse
                and Julie Delpy’s Celine nine years later for more walking, talking and romance. Written by the cast
                with their director, it feels like it emerged organically instead of being forced into existence. And
                it’s warm, witty and real when dealing with affairs of the heart, for good and ill.

            <h2>6.JERRY MAGUIRE</h2><br>
            <p>
                Cameron Crowe’s genre mash-up combines the pure joy of falling head over heels in love with the thrills
                of, erm, sports management deals. It’s more romantic than it sounds, delivering two of cinema’s greatest
                ever declarations of love within fifteen seconds: Tom Cruise’s “you complete me” dovetailing neatly into
                Renee Zellweger’s “you had me at hello”.

            <h2>7.ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF A SPOTLESS MIND</h2><br>
            <p>
                With a Charlie Kaufman script and Michel Gondry behind the camera, Eternal Sunshine dispenses with
                romantic conventions for ponderous ruminations on love, memory, and painful emotion. The non-linear
                narrative front-loads the break-up scenes, later offering a warmer look at the happy days of the
                relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), who make the drastic decision to
                forget each other entirely through a memory-erasing procedure.

            <h2>8.BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S</h2><br>
            <p>
                Leaving aside some of the more problematic elements that emerge when the film is viewed with a modern
                eye, Tiffany’s is powered by Audrey Hepburn’s nuclear-level charm as Holly Golightly, the socialite with
                an eye for a new neighbour and a dark past. Hepburn has commented about how tricky she found it to play
                Holly, but you’d never know it from the film, which grabs your attention and rarely lets go.
