            <p>Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the creative minds behind The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street, bring
                their unique talents to a fresh vision of a different Spider-Man Universe, with a groundbreaking visual
                style that’s the first of its kind. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse introduces Brooklyn teen Miles
                Morales, and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.</p>

            <h2>2.TOY STORY</h2><br>
            <p> it has dynamite buddy-duo dynamics in the bickering Buzz (Tim Allen) and Woody (Tom Hanks; it explores
                the emotions of anthropormorphised objects or animals; it creates an entire imaginative world from the
                seemingly everyday; and its screenplay is richly layered with characterisation and gags that work just
                as well for adults as they do for kids. The sequels might go bigger, but the original Toy Story is a
                pure blast of creative joy – and nothing since has been the same.

            <h2>4.INSIDE OUT</h2><br>
            <p>Few films can claim to have the sheer emotional intelligence of Inside Out – a film about intelligent
                emotions that's both a rollocking adventure, and a nuanced exploration of feelings, dreams, memory, and
                imagination. If the protagonist is technically Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), really it's the voices in her head
                – Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis
                Black) – that take centre stage. With all the upheaval of moving to San Francisco with her family,
                Riley's inner world is thrown into turmoil – teeing up an existential odyssey as Joy and Sadness careen
                through the corridors of her mind, via abstract thought, the dream factory, and halls filled with
                precious memories. It's beautifully conceptualised and gorgeously realised, culminating in perceptive
                notions about the need for sadness, and the way happy memories become tinged with melancholy over time.

            <h2>5.SPIRITED AWAY</h2><br>
            <p>
                The film that brought Studio Ghibli to the Western mainstream is, curiously, not its most accessible
                work – but Hayao Miyazaki's coming-of-age fairytale is so steeped in gorgeous, culturally-specific
                Japanese imagery it's no wonder it captured the world's imagination. Darker than your typical Disney
                fare, it centres on Chihiro (Remi Hiiragi) who becomes trapped in a grand, mythical bathhouse frequented
                by spirits after her parents are transformed into pigs. There, she's forced to work by the witch Yubaba
                (Mari Natsuki), and forms a friendship with dragon-boy Haku (Miyu Irino). If the narrative is often
                loose, especially as the film continues into its second hour, Spirited Away is beguiling and enchanting,
                conjuring up an entire world of curious creatures while contemplating notions of identity, spirituality,
                personal growth, environmentalism, and moral ambiguities that extend beyond simple good and evil.

            <h2>6.LION KING</h2><br>
            <p>
                As lion cub Simba (Matthew Broderick) grows up in the expanse of Pride Rock, experiences a
                life-shattering parental death, and eventually takes his father's place as the ruler of the animal
                kingdom. Timon and Pumbaa (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella) emerge as gold-standard sidekicks once Simba
                runs away from home, the Elton John-penned songs are off the chain ('The Circle Of Life'! 'Hakuna
                Matata'! 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King'!), and none other than James Earl Jones lends his booming voice
                to patriarch Mufasa. All these years later, it's even clearer – The Lion King ain't no passin' craze.

            <h2>7.UP</h2><br>
            <p>
                Everyone talks about the opening 10 minutes of Up. And rightly so – it's its own mini-masterpiece,
                beautiful and heartbreaking as adorable couple Carl and Ellie experience the ups (marriage, picnics,
                dancing) and downs (miscarriage, bereavement) of life in a single montage that guarantees floods of
                tears. But what comes next is equally miraculous – a wild, weird adventure movie in which the elderly
                Carl (Ed Asner) and energetic boy scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) unwittingly float away to South America
                on a flurry of vibrant balloons, encountering a giant bird called Kevin, a pack of talking dogs
                ("Squirrel!"), and an evil explorer. It's a heady mix, but director Pete Docter coheres it all
                spectacularly – the grounded grief and the exotic escapism somehow exist in perfect harmony. Now that's
                a Pixar miracle.

            <h2>8.RATATOUILLE</h2><br>
            <p>
                Director Brad Bird's most impressive feat is turning smells into sights – ingredients become wafts of
                abstract colour that complement each other as sub-par dishes become works of culinary art, a symphony of
                swirling scents completed by Michael Giacchino's gorgeous score. Patton Oswalt lends his voice to Remy –
                a rat with a gift for cookery who teams up with hopeless human Linguini (Lou Romano) in an effort to get
                his dishes out into the world. But given Remy's rodent status, the discovery of the real little chef
                would spell disaster for his future. Even by Pixar standards, this sometimes overlooked effort overflows
                with charm and beauty – just see the scene in which snooty critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) takes a bite
                of the film's titular dish and is transported back to the warmth and love of his own mother's cooking.
                Not bad for a film with a pretty basic pun title.
