                Many people find it difficult to prioritise self-care. Self-care is often misunderstood as selfish, 
                yet this could not be further from the reality! Self-care is an important element of taking care of 
                yourself as well as others.When you practice self-care you produce positive feelings, which boosts 
                motivation and self-esteem leaving you with increased energy to support yourself as well as your 
                loved ones. It starts with tending to your needs.

                    <li>Self-care can help you manage stress </li>
                    <br>
                    <p>While small amounts of stress is a healthy way to motivate you to get a task done, constant
                       stress and anxiety can have an adverse effect on your mental wellbeing and physical health.
                       Healthy habits like <a href="family_youth.html">spending time with loved ones</a> and

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Maintaining interests of your own helps to strengthen your relationship with your others,
                        by improving your sense of self worth. Relying solely on your family and friends to provide 
                        all your supports and to meet your every need could potentially put a huge strain on your relationships.

                        about your emotional well-being. It's also about taking care of your physical self by
