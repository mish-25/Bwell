        <h3>How to practice meditation?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b><u> Choose a quiet spot that is free of distractions</u></b> : Turn off your phone, television, and
                other
                distractions. Play quiet music, select something calm and repetitive or click on "Play Audio".</li>
            <li><b><u>Set a time limit:</u></b> Start off with shorter sessions and then increase according to
                requirement.
            </li>
            <li><b><u>Pay attention to your body and get comfortable</u></b> : You can sit cross-legged on the floor or
                in a
                chair
                as long as you feel that you can sit comfortably for several minutes at a time.</li>
            <li><b><u>Focus on your breathing</u></b> : Try taking deep breaths that expand your belly and then slowly
                exhale. Pay
                attention to how each breath feels.</li>
            <li><b><u>Notice your thoughts</u></b> : The purpose of meditation is not to clear your mindâ€”your mind is
                inevitably
                going to wander. Instead, focus on gently bringing your attention back to your breath whenever you
                notice
                your thoughts drifting. Don't judge your thoughts or try to analyze them; simply direct your mind back
                to
                your deep breathing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When you meditate, you may clear away the information overload that builds up every day and contributes to
            your
            stress. Building skills to manage your stress, increasing self-awareness, focusing on the present, reducing
            negative emotions, increasing imagination andcreativity, increasing patience and tolerance are some of the
            emotional benefits of meditation.

        </p>

            While experts do not yet fully understand exactly how meditation works, research has clearly demonstrated
            that
            meditative techniques can have a range of positive effects on overall health and psychological well-being.
