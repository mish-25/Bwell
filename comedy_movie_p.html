            <h2>7.HOME ALONE</h2><br>
            <p>
                Home Alone is a 1990 American comedy blockbuster film directed by Chris Columbus written and produced by
                John Hughes and distributed by 20th Century Studios. It was followed by two theatrical sequels, two
                made-for-television films, and a reboot.

                Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin), an eight-year-old boy whose wish of his family to disappear comes
                true when they mistakenly left him at home when they go on a vacation to Paris for Christmas.

                While initially relishing time by himself, he is later greeted by two burglars, Harry and Marv, who are
                played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, respectively. Kevin eventually manages to outwit them with a
                series of booby traps.
