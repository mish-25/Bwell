                Most of the young children as well as teenagers are often restless as they have a lot of energy.
                Relaxation activites can help them calm down and channelize their energy better.
                Finding the perfect balance between work and leisure, as well as being able to unwind in our 
                spare time, is a difficult undertaking. Our mind, body, and soul all require rest from time to 
                time so that we can feel revived and ready to face the next challenges with a fresh energy and 
                clarity of mind. Relaxation isn't only about peace of mind or enjoying a hobby. Relaxation is 
                a process that decreases the effects of stress on your mind and body. Relaxation techniques can 
                help you cope with everyday stress and with stress related to various health problems.
