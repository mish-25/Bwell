                Finding the perfect balance between work and leisure, as well as being able to unwind in our 
                spare time, is a difficult undertaking. Our mind, body, and soul all require rest from time to 
                time so that we can feel revived and ready to face the next challenges with a fresh energy and 
                clarity of mind. Relaxation isn't only about peace of mind or enjoying a hobby. Relaxation is 
                a process that decreases the effects of stress on your mind and body. Relaxation techniques can 
                help you cope with everyday stress and with stress related to various health problems, such as heart disease and pain.

                <h4>Here's some things that you can do:</h4>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Listen to relaxing music<br>
                        <p>Music is one of the best, easier, and faster ways to take our mind off our everyday worries. Create a playlist 
                            of your favorite relaxing tracks and listen before going to bed.</p>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Meditate<br>
                        <p>Meditation can be truly live changing. It gives your mind the time it needs to rest.</p>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Nature walks<br>
                        <p>To be close to the nature is a deep and essential need of the human being. Go for a relaxing walk, breath the 
                            fresh air, pay attention to the smells and sounds around you, so you can lose yourself to the experience.</p>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Massages<br>
                        <p>A massage shouldn't be seen as a luxury activity, but as a natural part of your daily routine. A good massage 
                            can have a deep impact in your body and mind.</p>

                    <li>
                        Reading<br>
                        <p>Reading is one of the best ways to relax. According to recent researches, even a few minutes of reading can 
                            be enough to reduce the stress levels by more than two thirds. Writing is also a highly cathartic activity that also stimulates your imagination. </p>
