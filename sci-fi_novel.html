            <h2>1.DUNE BY FRANK HERBERT</h2><br>
            <p>As cliché as this might be (since this book seems to be the number one on every list), this book just
                seems
                to be a classic, a story that can be read over and over. Therefore Dune has turned up as the number one
                on
                my list.

                The novel is set about 20,000 years ahead with Dune Leto as the main character. The plot of this novel
                takes
                some excitingly shocking twists that leave the readers in suspense. The ending is definitely a cliff
                hanger
                which will make the reader want to keep reading on. The Dune series have been a popular hit since the
                1990’s
                coming a long way up to 2009.</p>

            <h2>2.THE HICTHHIKER'S GUIDE TO TO THE GALAXY BY DOUGLAS ADAMS</h2><br>
            <p>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the first book (1979) in the highly popular series of comic science
                fiction novels by British writer Douglas Adams. The saga mocks modern society with humour and cynicism.
                What if the world ended tomorrow—where would you get your favorite drink?

                That's the situation faced by Arthur Dent, totally normal English guy (favorite drink: tea). Arthur
                isn't a hero—he's actually pretty boring—but after Earth is destroyed, Arthur is thrust into a series of
                crazy adventures that he's totally unprepared for. That might sound like a tragedy (after all, Earth is
                where our favorite food is made), but take it from us: it's totally a comedy. Lots of comedies begin
                with the destruction of Earth, right?

            <h2>3.SNOW CRASH BY NEAL STEPHENSON</h2><br>
            <p>Snow Crash is a science fiction novel by the American writer Neal Stephenson, published in 1992. Like
                many of Stephenson's novels, it covers history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, religion,
                computer science, politics, cryptography, memetics, and philosophy.Stephenson explained the title of the
                novel as his term for a particular software failure mode on the
                early Macintosh computer.
                The book presents the Sumerian language as the firmware programming language for the brainstem, which is
                supposedly functioning as the BIOS for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess
                Asherah is the personification of a linguistic virus, similar to a computer virus. The god Enki created
                a counter-program, which he called a nam-shub, that caused all of humanity to speak different languages
                as a protection against Asherah (a re-interpretation of the ancient Near Eastern story of the Tower of
                Babel).

            <h2>4.THE HANDMAID'S TALE BY MARGARET ATWOOD</h2><br>
            <p>The Handmaid's Tale is a futuristic dystopian novel[6] by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, published in
                1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a strongly patriarchal, white supremacist,
                totalitarian theonomic state, known as the Republic of Gilead, which has overthrown the United States
                government. The central character and narrator is a woman named Offred, one of the group known as
                "handmaids", who are forcibly assigned to produce children for the "commanders" — the ruling class of
                men in Gilead.

                The novel explores themes of subjugated women in a patriarchal society, loss of female agency and
                individuality, suppression of women's reproductive rights, and the various means by which women resist
                and attempt to gain individuality and independence. The novel's title echoes the component parts of
                Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which is a series of connected stories (such as "The Merchant's
                Tale" and "The Parson's Tale"). It is also an allusion to the tradition of fairy tales where the
                central character tells their story.

            <h2>5.NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR BY GEORGE ORWELL</h2><br>
            <p>
                The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to
                perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great
                Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, ruled by
                the Party, who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big
                Brother, the dictatorial leader of Oceania, enjoys an intense cult of personality, manufactured by the
                party's excessive brainwashing techniques. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful
                rank-and-file worker at the Ministry of Truth and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and
                dreams of rebellion. He expresses his dissent by writing in a diary and later enters into a forbidden
                relationship with his colleague Julia and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to
                power.

            <h2>6.THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES BY RAY BRADBURY</h2><br>
            <p>
                Radically poetic and rich with metaphor, The Martian Chronicles was an astonishing leap forward for a
                genre until then not considered sufficiently “literary.” Bradbury’s succession of linked stories opens
                on an Earth ravaged by nuclear warfare. In search of a new beginning, Americans pack up their manifest
                destiny and blast off to conquer Mars, but little do they know, the red planet will conquer them in
                return. Bradbury’s Mars is a dreamlike landscape of wasted cities, populated by a dwindling race of
                ancient, unknowable beings. In glimmering stories that swing from dark tragedy to pure comedy, Bradbury
                showcases mankind’s exploration and desolation of Mars, all while dismantling midcentury mythologies of
                American exceptionalism. Told in language at once elegiac and sinister, fantastical and fable-like, The
                Martian Chronicles transforms and transcends its genre.

            <h2>7.THE THREE BODY PROBLEM BY CIXIN LIU</h2><br>
            <p>
                One of China’s most acclaimed science fiction writers opens his Hugo Award-winning Remembrance of
                Earth’s Past trilogy with The Three-Body Problem, a gripping first contact thriller set against the
                backdrop of China’s Cultural Revolution. When a young physicist comes to work at the government’s
                secretive Red Coast Base, she soon learns that frontier scientists are communicating with
                extraterrestrials—and they’re planning to make a hostile visit. Enormous in scope, rich in both
                twisty-turny mysteries and big ideas about progress, The Three Body-Problem marks the ascension of a
                writer bound to become every bit as canonical as Arthur C. Clarke or Isaac Asimov. This series will soon
                become a Netflix series from Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, so get in on the
                ground floor while you still can.

            <h2>8.NEVER LET ME GO BY KAZUO ISHIGURO</h2><br>
            <p>
                One can’t say too much about Never Let Me Go without spoiling the novel’s gut-wrenching twist. But
                here’s what we can reveal: in Ishiguro’s chilling magnum opus, we meet three students of Hailsham, a
                quixotic English boarding school where sheltered children are educated in the arts and taught nothing of
                the outside world. Only when they become adults do they learn the shocking truth about Hailsham’s
                nefarious activities, and the reality of their terrible purpose. At once an arresting mystery, a Gothic
                romance, and a tear-jerking work of science fiction, Never Let Me Go is a masterpiece of tension and
                tone, as well as a powerful indictment of a future shaped by science without ethics.

            <h2>9.KINDERED BY OCTAVIA BUTLER</h2><br>
            <p>
                Octavia Butler’s contributions to science fiction and Afrofuturism are legendary, meaning that selecting
                just one of her works for this list was a tall order. But Kindred, perhaps her best-known novel, stood
                out above the rest as a master class in the ability of science fiction to speak to the contemporary
                moment. This is the story of Dana, a Black woman in Los Angeles circa 1976, who finds herself violently
                transported back in time to the antebellum plantation where her ancestors were enslaved. Each time she
                pinballs through past and present, Dana’s stays at the plantation become longer and more dangerous,
                forcing her to confront the gruesome legacies of slavery, misogynoir, and white supremacy. As Harlan
                Ellison once said, “Octavia Butler is a writer who will be with us for a long, long time, and Kindred is
                that rare magical artifact… the novel one returns to, again and again.” Almost like time travel, we keep
                coming back to it.

            <h2>10.ANNIHILATION BY JEFF VANDERMEER</h2><br>
            <p>
                In this spectacular blend of science fiction and climate fiction, VanderMeer sets his sights on Area X,
                a lush and remote landscape that has turned against humankind, producing brain-bending effects on
                scientists who venture into the territory to investigate. As the secrets of Area X reveal themselves not
                just to the scientists, but to the disorganized agency that monitors these expeditions, the bureaucratic
                and ecological consequences pile upward. Dreadful, Lovecraftian, and downright existential, Annihilation
                is a dizzying descent into a metaphysical wilderness leagues away from our lived reality.
